A system where boxes are packed and finally moved forward.

<h4>System description</h4>
<p>There are 2 conveyors and 2 pneumatic cylinders. Each conveyor has a motor commanded with a motor contactor to run it forward, connected to outputs &ldquo;oSUB01_K1&rdquo; and &ldquo;oSUB02_K1&rdquo;. Conveyor 1 has a sensor in the begining and another at the end (connected to &ldquo;iSUB01_B1&rdquo; and &ldquo;iSUB01_B2&rdquo;), and conveyor 2 as well (connected to &ldquo;iSUB02_B1&rdquo; and &ldquo;iSUB02_B2&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The pneumatic cylinders are single acting cylinders commanded with one valve each, connected to outputs &ldquo;oSUB01_Y1&rdquo; and &ldquo;oSUB02_Y1&rdquo; respectively. The cylinder 1 makes possible to push a box from conveyor 1 to conveyor 2 and cylinder 2 can be used to pack boxes in conveyor 2.&nbsp;Each cylinder has one sensors to know if it is expanded &ldquo;iSUB01_B3&ldquo; and &ldquo;iSUB02_B3&ldquo;.</p>
<p>The system includes a panel with a button to drop a box on conveyor 1.</p>
<h4>Workflow:</h4>
<p>Boxes are dropped in Conveyor 1 using the button on the panel. The boxes should be moved forward and then pushed to the conveyor 2. Once in the conveyor 2 the boxes should be pushed against previous boxes in order to pack them. When the pack of boxes reaches the sensor at the end of conveyor 2, the conveyor 2 should be emptied. New boxes can be placed just if both conveyors are stopped.</p>
