A system with a turning conveyor which can handle one or two boxes at the time.

<h4>System description</h4>
<p>There are 3 conveyors belts, 2 of them are regular conveyors (1 and 3), but conveyor 2 is also a turning conveyor. This means that it can rotate on its vertical axis. Each conveyor has a motor commanded with a motor contactor to run it forward. The contactors are connected to outputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Motor1Fwd&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Motor3Fwd&rdquo;</em>. Conveyor 1 has a sensor ("SensorDrop") to detect when a box is dropped and another sensor ("Sensor1") to detect when a box has reached the end of the conveyor. Conveyor 2 has two sensors ("Sensor2" and "Sensor3") to position boxes in the middle and end of the conveyor. Conveyor 3 has just a sensor ("Sensor6") at the end.&nbsp;Conveyor 2 has an additional motor contactor to make the conveyor turn. Running the turning motor reverse, it aligns conveyor 2 with 1, running it forward with conveyor 3, "<em>TurnFwd&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;TurnRev&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;PLC outputs are used for that. Two sensors connected to inputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor4&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor5&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;are placed to know if it is on&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;or&nbsp;forward&nbsp;position respectively.</p>
<p>The system includes a panel with one button to drop a box on conveyor 1. When the box reaches the end of conveyor 3 will be automatically removed after 5 seconds.</p>
<h4>Workflow:</h4>
<p>It is assumed that a box can be dropped just when the conveyor 1 is empty and stopped.&nbsp;The sequence starts when a box is dropped in Conveyor 1 (using a button from the panel) which is automatically detected by the sensor. The box should be moved to conveyor 2 directly. Once in conveyor 2, the box should stop at "Sensor2" and wait for 5 seconds. If during this time a new box is dropped in conveyor 1 the second box should also be loaded in conveyor 2, reching "Sensor3". In both cases the box or boxes will be delivered to conveyor 3 by turning forward and back the conveyor 2, and finally removed. When the box or boxes are removed from conveyor 3 a new box can be loaded to conveyor 2.</p>
