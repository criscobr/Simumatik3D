A system with one input and two output conveyors with a pneumatic double acting cylinder in the middle.

<h4>System description</h4>
<p>There are 4 conveyors, all of them are regular conveyors, but conveyor 2 has also a pneumatic cylinder. This cylinder makes possible to push a box to conveyor 4. Each conveyor has a motor commanded with a motor contactor to run it forward. The contactors are connected to outputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;MotorControl1&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;MotorControl4&rdquo;</em>. Each conveyor has also one sensor (sensors 1 to 4) which will be activated if any box (small or big) goes through the conveyor and crosses the detection line. An additional sensor (sensor 5) is placed on conveyor 2 to detect just the big boxes. The sensors are connected to PLC inputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor1&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor5&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>The pneumatic cylinder placed on conveyor 2 is a double acting cylinder commanded with 2 valves. Valve 1 makes the cylinder expand and valve 2 compresses the cylinder, both are connected to outputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;OpenValve1&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;OpenValve2&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;respectively. Two sensors connected to inputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor6&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sensor7&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;are placed on the cylinder to know if it is compressed or expanded respectively.</p>
<p>The system includes a panel with one button to drop small or big boxes on conveyor 1.</p>
<h4>Workflow:</h4>
<p>The sequence starts when a box is dropped in Conveyor 1 (using the button on the panel) which is automatically detected by the sensor. The box should be moved to conveyor 2 directly. Once in conveyor 2, the box should stop at sensor 2 and after 1 second when the dimension is determined, it should be moved to the proper conveyor. A small box should be moved to conveyor 3. A big box should be pushed to conveyor 4 using the cylinder. Then the box is moved until the sensor in conveyor 4 is activated. When the box arrives to conveyor 3 or 4 it can be removed manually in order to empty the system and restart the sequence.</p>
