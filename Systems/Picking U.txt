The classic Picking U station on a pallet conveyor system.

<h4 style="font-size: 13px;">System description</h4>
<p>There are 3 conveyors in the system. Conveyors 1 and 3 are chain conveyors and Conveyor 2 is a roller conveyor 5 cm lower than&nbsp;the other two. Each chain conveyor is divided into&nbsp;two parts, a static part, and a movable part called transfer. Transfers move up and down using a double acting cylinder to align them with the chains or place them below the rollers. Conveyor 1 has a sensor called "Conv1Sensor1" that detects a new pallet as soon as it is dropped into the system. Conveyor 2 has three sensors, "Conv2Sensor1" in the beginning, to detect pallets coming&nbsp;from Conveyor 1, "Conv2Sensor2" in the middle, and "Conv2Sensor3" at the end, to stop pallets before transferring&nbsp;them to Conveyor 3.&nbsp;Conveyor 2 has a pneumatic stopper in the middle, to ensure an accurate stop in this position, also actuated by a double acting&nbsp;cylinder. Conveyor 3 has a sensor called "Conv3Sensor1" at the end.</p>
<p>The conveyor motors are commanded with motor contactors to run them forward, connected to outputs &ldquo;Conv1Fwd&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conv2Fwd&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conv3Fwd&rdquo;. The three double-acting cylinders are commanded using 5/3 way solenoid valves which are connected&nbsp;to outputs "CylXUp" and "CylXDown"&nbsp;(where X is the number of the cylinder/conveyor). Cylinders&nbsp;are equipped&nbsp;with two sensors to detect their position, connected to inputs "CylXSensorUp" and "CylXSensorDown".</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 13px;">Workflow:</h4>
<p>A new pallet&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #f6d5d9;">can be&nbsp;</span>dropped in Conveyor 1. The transfer in Conveyor 1 moves up and the pallet travels all the way forward until it reaches Conveyor 2. The transfer&nbsp;goes down placing the pallet on the rollers and the pneumatic stopper in Conveyor 2 up. The pallet travels forward and stops in the middle position against the stopper. The pallet waits 2 seconds there and then the pneumatic stopper goes down to allow the pallet move to the end of Conveyor 2. Finally, the transfer in Conveyor 3 moves up and the pallet travels until it is detected by the sensor in Conveyor 3. Once the pallet is removed from Conveyor 3 a new pallet can be introduced in Conveyor 1.</p>
