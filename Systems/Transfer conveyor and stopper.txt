A system with a transfer conveyor and a pneumatic stopper.

<h4>System description</h4>
<p style="line-height: 20.9px; text-align: justify;">Conveyors 1 and 2 are roller conveyors and conveyor 3 is a chain conveyors. The chain conveyor is higher than the roller conveyors, so there is a transfer conveyor on conveyor 2 connected to a vertical pneumatic cylinder to allow transfer between rollers and chains. In addition to the transfer conveyor there is another cylinder with a stopper that can be extended to stop a box just in front of conveyor 3, centered with the transfer conveyor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 20.9px; text-align: justify;">Each conveyor has a motor commanded with a motor contactor to run it forward, including the transfer conveyor. The contactors are connected to outputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Conv1Fwd&rdquo;/</em><em>&ldquo;Conv3Fwd&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>"TranFwd"</em>. Conveyor 1 and 3 have one sensor which will be activated if a box is in position, conveyor 2 has two, one for the transfer and the other for the end position.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.9px;">An additional sensor "Conv2Size" is placed on conveyor 2 to detect just the big boxes</span><span style="line-height: 20.9px;">.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 20.9px; text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 20.9px;">The cylinders are single acted and activated by two valves connected to outputs&nbsp;</span><em style="line-height: 20.9px;">"TransUp"</em><span style="line-height: 20.9px;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em style="line-height: 20.9px;">"StopUp"</em><span style="line-height: 20.9px;">.&nbsp;</span>Two sensors connected to inputs&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;TransUpPos&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;<em style="line-height: 20.9px;">StopUpPos</em>&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;are placed to know if the cylinders are in the higher positions respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 20.9px; text-align: justify;">The system includes a panel with two buttons to drop small or big boxes on conveyor 1.</p>
<h4>Workflow:</h4>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The sequence starts when a box is dropped in Conveyor 1 (using a button from the panel) which is automatically detected by the sensor. The box should be moved to conveyor 2 directly. Big boxes should stop at the transfer conveyor and then moved to conveyor 3. Small boxes should go to the end of conveyor 2. When a box arrives at the end of conveyor 2 or 3 and is removed, the sequence can start again.</span></p>
